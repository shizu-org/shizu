# Macro to define an enumeration of operating systems and detect the operating system.
#
# First, the enumeration constants ${target}.operating_system_(unknown|windows|unix|linux|macos|cygwin|msys|mingw|ios|ios_simulator) are defined.
# Each constant is a string of an unique name identifying an operating system.
#
# Second, the constant ${target}.operating_system is defined to the ${target}.operating_system_* value denoting the detected operating system.
#
# @param target The target.
#
# @remarks
# - "mingw" and/or "msys" is a "toolchain". The "operating system" is still "windows".
# - We are not aware of a reliable procedure to detect what Apple "operating system" is used.
#   This configuration script detects "Mac OS" even if the "operating system" is "iOS", "iOS Simulator", "watchOS", ... from within CMake?
