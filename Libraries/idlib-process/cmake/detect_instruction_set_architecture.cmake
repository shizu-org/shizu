# First, the enumeration constants ${target}.instruction_set_architecture_(x86|x64) are defined.
# Each constant is a string of an unique name identifying an instruction set architecture.
#
# Second, the constant ${target}.instruction_set_architecture is defined to the ${target}.instruction_set_architecture_* value denoting the detected instruction set architecture.
#
# @param target The target.
