# SUMMARY
# Define an enumeration of operating systems and detect the operating system.
#
# DETAIL
# Define an enumeration of operating systems and detect the operating system.
# The detailed steps are:
# a) Define an enumeration of operating systems.
#    The enumeration constants ${target}.operating_system_(unknown|windows|unix|linux|macos|cygwin|msys|mingw|ios|ios_simulator) are defined.
#    Each constant is a string of an unique name identifying an operating system.
# b) The constant ${target}.operating_system is defined to the ${target}.operating_system_* value denoting the detected operating system.
#
# PARAM target The target.
#
# REMARKS:
# - "MinGW" and "MSYS" is toolchains. The operating system is still "Windows".
# - We are not aware of a reliable procedure to detect what Apple operating system is used.
#   This configuration script detects "MacOS" even if the operating system is "iOS", "iOS Simulator", or "watchOS".
